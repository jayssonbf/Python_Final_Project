# Python | Rock, Paper, and Scissors

Rock, Paper, and Scissors is a game for two players typically played using the players' hands, but in this program, hands are not needed because the program does this job for you. The two players each select a weapon (rock, paper, or scissors) and depending on the players selection, the winner is displayed on the screen.
