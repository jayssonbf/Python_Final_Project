# Exercise selected: Lab 9.5
# Name of program: Going Green
# Description of program:  This program will prompt the user to enter
# the energy bills from January to December for the year prior to going green
# Next, allow the user to enter the energy bills from January to December of
# the past year after going green.  The program should calculate the energy difference from
# the two years and display the two years worth of data, along with the savings.
